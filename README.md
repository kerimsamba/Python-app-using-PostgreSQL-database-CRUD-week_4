INTRODUCTION

Vet Manager is designed to simulate an application to manage a the day to day running of a vet practice. Expanding on the initial brief, the interface was designed to enable easy import onto tablet devices with the idea that the user would not be tied to a desk to enable use.

The application allows owner, pet and vet data to be uploaded and then edited, allowing the practice to track the pets it treats, store owner contact data and allocate patients to the vets working there. 

INSTALLATION:

The application is run by initiating the ‘vet_manager’ sql database first, then running the python3 console file and finally running flask.

The application uses python 3 for its base code, running a flask framework to link into the html, Jinja2 is used to run Flask itself and the data is stored in sql.

DESIGN NOTES:

No bootstrap or editors were used in the design of the front end with some relatively simple css employed to generate the user interface. The current database data is entered when running the console file but it is envisaged that it would be either be entered from scratch or imported were the application to be used in a commercial environment.

No bugs are currently reported.

Further expansions planned but not implemented included an appointment system (with a daily overview of appointments on the home page) and more sophisticated recording of treatments for each pet.

COPYRIGHT, DATA, PULL REQUESTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS:

There are no copyright restrictions on this code and all the test data was created purely for this application with privacy issues anticipated. Pull requests and contributions are welcome.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:

I’d like to thank my fellow CodeClan G32 Cohort colleagues for their assistance with various parts of the code and particularly CodeClan instructors Ben and Ali, without whom there would simply not be a working application.
